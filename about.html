            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Dark Pattern Detection Chrome Extension is a tool designed to help users identify and understand dark patterns on the web. Dark patterns are deceptive design practices used to manipulate users into making choices they might not have made otherwise. This extension aims to bring awareness to these practices and provide users with the tools to navigate the web more ethically.</p>

            <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
            <p>In the digital age, web designers and developers often use dark patterns to trick users into actions they would not have taken otherwise. These patterns can include misleading buttons, hidden fees, or coercive design elements. Our motivation is to empower users by equipping them with a tool that can identify these manipulative tactics and help them make more informed decisions online.</p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>Our extension offers a range of features designed to help users detect and understand dark patterns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automatic Detection:</strong> Identifies dark patterns on web pages as you browse.</li>
                <li><strong>Suspicious Element Highlighting:</strong> Highlights elements that may be using dark patterns without altering the page's content.</li>
                <li><strong>Crowdsourced Reporting:</strong> Allows users to report new dark patterns to build a more comprehensive dataset.</li>
                <li><strong>HTML Report Generation:</strong> Provides a downloadable report that highlights detected dark patterns for future reference.</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern Removal:</strong> Allows users to toggle and remove unwanted patterns from the DOM for a clearer browsing experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Resources:</strong> Links to resources and guides to help users understand different types of dark patterns.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The extension uses a combination of heuristic algorithms and user feedback to detect dark patterns. It scans the web page's DOM for known patterns and highlights suspicious elements. Users can then view these elements, report new patterns, or remove the patterns from the DOM. The extension also generates a report summarizing the detected patterns and providing educational resources for users to learn more.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>We plan to expand the extensionâ€™s capabilities in future updates. This includes enhancing detection algorithms, adding more educational content on trickery patterns, and improving the user interface based on user feedback. We are also exploring partnerships with other organizations and experts to further our mission of promoting ethical web design practices.</p>
